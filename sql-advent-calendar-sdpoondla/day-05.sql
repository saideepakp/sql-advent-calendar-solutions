-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

select e.elf_name, 
  case when v.return_date is NOT NULL then v.return_date
  else "Still resting"
  end as Return_date
from elves e
full OUTER join vacations v
on e.elf_id = v.elf_id
