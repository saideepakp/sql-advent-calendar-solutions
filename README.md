📊 SQL Advent Calendar Challenge – Interview Master AI

📌 Overview

This repository documents my participation in the SQL Advent Calendar Challenge organized by InterviewMaster.ai, where I solved one SQL problem every day for 24 consecutive days.

The objective of this challenge was not only to practice SQL concepts, but also to build consistency, discipline, and problem-solving habits through daily hands-on practice. By committing solutions regularly, I reinforced my ability to think analytically under time constraints—a key requirement for real-world data analytics and SQL interview scenarios.

All solutions are written with a focus on readability, correctness, and interview-ready logic, reflecting how SQL is expected to be used in professional analytics roles.






🎯 What This Challenge Covered

The challenge exposed me to a wide range of SQL concepts commonly used in data analysis and business intelligence, including:
	•	Data filtering, sorting, and aggregation
	•	Complex JOIN operations across multiple tables
	•	Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
	•	Window functions for ranking, running totals, and comparisons
	•	Analytical problem-solving using business-style datasets

Beyond technical skills, the challenge emphasized:
	•	Consistency through daily problem-solving
	•	Structured thinking when breaking down complex queries
	•	Clean SQL writing suitable for interviews and production use
	•	Gradual progression from basic queries to more advanced analytical patterns

Overall, this experience strengthened both my SQL proficiency and my confidence in handling interview-style SQL problems in a systematic and efficient manner.
